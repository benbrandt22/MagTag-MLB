This file serves as a place to collect various changes/fixes/improvements I want to make to the project


- add boolean methods/properties to the game detail object to check if it's Delayed/Postponed

- Figure out how to identify and properly handle delayed/postponed games

- Schedule - when not in a live game, sleep until midnight instead of every 2 hours, because midnight is the only time the view will change (the day labels)

- create a "basic game" type to hold gamePk, status, date, use in API calls at app startup

- Analyze past MLB games to see how often games go into extra innings, and typically how many innings. Work on better scoreboard display logic for high-inning games.

- Indicate battery level somehow. Red light when low? Icon on screen?

- (maybe) play sound for runs? (Circuitpython on this board currently can only support playing simple tones, not wav files)

- (maybe) only update display when model changes?
