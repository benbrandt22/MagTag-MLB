This file serves as a place to collect various changes/fixes/improvements I want to make to the project

- Figure out how to identify and properly handle delayed/postponed games

- Analyze past MLB games to see how often games go into extra innings, and typically how many innings. Work on better scoreboard display logic for high-inning games.

- Indicate battery level somehow. Red light when low? Icon on screen?
    - figure out at what voltage the device typically shuts down, and display a notice on-screen when battery is near-low

- (maybe) play sound for runs? (Circuitpython on this board currently can only support playing simple tones, not wav files)

- (maybe) only update display when model changes?
